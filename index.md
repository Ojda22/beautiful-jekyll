I'm a Doctorate Candidate at the Luxembourg University, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust [SnT](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt), headed by [Prof. Dr Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon). While under direct supervision of [Dr Michail (Mike) Papadakis](https://mpapad.github.io/).

My academic and industrial interests lie in the area of Software Engineering. In particular Software Evolution, Software Testing, Code Analysis, Fault Injection and Intelligent Software Engineering (synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering).

[comment]: My inspiration is to contribute and deliver practical and powerful test environments to software practitioners. Requiring highly assured software at a reasonable cost _(why do we need assuring software nowadays, well, I will let you conclude)_. The vision is an environment that provides complete automation to the testers.
