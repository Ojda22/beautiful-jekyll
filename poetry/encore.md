<h2 align="center">"Encore" by Patricia Fleming</h2>

<div align="center">
<br>
Those things that meant the most to me<br> 
Are no longer in my life. <br> 
And those people most important <br> 
Have vanished now from sight. <br>
<br>
Future hopes and longing dreams <br>
Simply don't exist. <br>
And that person who I used to be <br>
Is someone I sadly miss. <br>
<br>
Memories of my former life <br>
Leave my heart in pain <br>
And remind me of reality <br>
And that everything must change. <br>
<br>
This world can be so fickle. <br>
One day you fade from all their minds. <br>
You're not needed or acknowledged <br>
They just leave you far behind. <br>
<br>
I've struggled through some desperate times, <br>
Through raging storms and seas. <br>
My life has been an uphill climb. <br>
I didn't make it here with ease. <br>
<br>
Old age has been a state I've earned. <br>
It's a feat that I've survived. <br>
I made mistakes but learned from them, <br>
And I say that now with pride. <br>
<br>
So where are my gold medals? <br>
My name up there in lights? <br>
I was not the smartest or the prettiest, <br>
But I fought a darn good fight! <br>
<br>
Where is all the grand applause <br>
And shouts of "Way to go!"? <br>
Where are all the kudos <br>
That I feel that I am owed? <br>
<br>
Then I will sing my praises, <br>
Give myself a big high five! <br>
You fought the fight quite valiantly, <br>
And you're still well and quite alive. <br>
<br>
You are someone with a heart of gold <br>
And a soul that's kept its light. <br>
You have loved and lost and sacrificed. <br>
You weren't perfect, but you tried. <br>
<br>
And I proclaim to all aged folks <br>
Who have lived beyond four score, <br>
You are truly Golden Heroes, <br>
And may you survive a hundred more! <br>
